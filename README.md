esri js api 4.15, try building group layer with 3 layer with some complex unique value renderer, not working well

https://shaharbukra.github.io/Renderer/

when you first open the link, open fiddler\f12 
checkout the Network tab for the time it take to load all the renderer
(it take around 5-9 second loading the layers without any data source in them)

is there anything we can do to improve it?
